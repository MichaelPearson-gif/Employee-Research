# Employee-Research
I will be creating an SQL database from six csv files of employee info from the 1980's and 1990's.
Once I have the database and tables created, I will begin to analyze the employee data. 

# Project Purpose
The employer needed to evaluate past employees in order to more effectively select future employees who's traits matched those of successful past employees.
